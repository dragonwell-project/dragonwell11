 * The figure above describes the structure and usage of {@code ResourceContainer}.
 * <p>
 * The main Thread is bounded to root container which can be fetched by
 * {@link ResourceContainer#root()}. Root Container is the system default
 * {@code ResourceContainer} without any resource restrictions.
 * Newly created threads are implicitly bounded to {@code ResourceContainer}
 * of the parent thread.
 * <p>
 * A Thread can invoke {@link ResourceContainer#run(Runnable command)} to
 * attach to the {@code ResourceContainer} and run the {@code command},
 * the resource usage of the thread is controlled by the {@code ResourceContainer}'s
 * constraints while running the command.
 * When the execution of the command is either finished normally
 * or terminated by Exception, the thread will be detached from the container automatically.
 * <p>
 * Components of a {@code ResourceContainer} implementation:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link ResourceType}: an implementation can customize some ResourceType</li>
 *     <li>{@code ResourceContainer}: Implements a class extends
 *     {@link AbstractResourceContainer}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ResourceContainerFactory}: service provider </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * {@code ResourceContainer} needs to be created from a set of {@code Constraint}s
 * <p>
 * In most cases, the following idiom should be used:
 *  <pre>
 *    ResourceContainer resourceContainer = containerFactory.createContainer(
 *      Arrays.asList(
 *          CPU_PERCENT.newConstraint(50),
 *          HEAP_RETAINED.newConstraint(100_000_000)
 *    ));
 *
 *    resourceContainer.run(requestHandler);
 *
 *    resourceContainer.destroy();
 *  </pre>
