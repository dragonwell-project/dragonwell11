/**
 * SlidingForwarding is a method to store forwarding information in a compressed form into the object header,
 * that has been specifically designed for sliding compaction GCs and compact object headers. With compact object
 * headers, we store the compressed class pointer in the header, which would be overwritten by full forwarding
 * pointer, if we allow the legacy forwarding code to act. This would lose the class information for the object,
 * which is required later in GC cycle to iterate the reference fields and get the object size for copying.
 *
 * SlidingForwarding requires only small side tables and guarantees constant-time access and modification.
 *
 * The idea is to use a pointer compression scheme very similar to the one that is used for compressed oops.
 * We divide the heap into number of logical regions. Each region spans maximum of 2^NUM_OFFSET_BITS words.
 *
 * The key advantage of sliding compaction for encoding efficiency: it can forward objects from one region to a
 * maximum of two regions. This is an intuitive property: when we slide the compact region full of data, it can
 * only span two adjacent regions. This property allows us to use the off-side table to record the addresses of
 * two target regions. The table holds N*2 entries for N logical regions. For each region, it gives the base
 * address of the two target regions, or a special placeholder if not used. A single bit in forwarding would
 * indicate to which of the two "to" regions the object is forwarded into.
 *
 * This encoding efficiency allows to store the forwarding information in the object header _together_ with the
 * compressed class pointer.
 *
 * When recording the sliding forwarding, the mark word would look roughly like this:
 *
 *   64                              32                                0
 *    [................................OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAFTT]
 *                                                                    ^----- normal lock bits, would record "object is forwarded"
 *                                                                  ^------- fallback bit (explained below)
 *                                                                 ^-------- alternate region select
 *                                     ^------------------------------------ in-region offset
 *     ^-------------------------------------------------------------------- protected area, *not touched* by this code, useful for
 *                                                                           compressed class pointer with compact object headers
 *
 * Adding a forwarding then generally works as follows:
 *   1. Compute the "to" offset in the "to" region, this gives "offset".
 *   2. Check if the primary "from" offset at base table contains "to" region base, use it.
 *      If not usable, continue to next step. If usable, set "alternate" = "false" and jump to (4).
 *   3. Check if the alternate "from" offset at base table contains "to" region base, use it.
 *      This gives us "alternate" = "true". This should always complete for sliding forwarding.
 *   4. Compute the mark word from "offset" and "alternate", write it out
 *
 * Similarly, looking up the target address, given an original object address generally works as follows:
 *   1. Load the mark from object, and decode "offset" and "alternate" from there
 *   2. Compute the "from" base offset from the object
 *   3. Look up "to" region base from the base table either at primary or alternate indices, using "alternate" flag
 *   4. Compute the "to" address from "to" region base and "offset"
 *
 * This algorithm is broken by G1 last-ditch serial compaction: there, object from a single region can be
 * forwarded to multiple, more than two regions. To deal with that, we initialize a fallback-hashtable for
 * storing those extra forwardings, and set another bit in the header to indicate that the forwardee is not
 * encoded but should be looked-up in the hashtable. G1 serial compaction is not very common - it is the
 * last-last-ditch GC that is used when the JVM is scrambling to squeeze more space out of the heap, and at
 * that point, ultimate performance is no longer the main concern.

   * A simple hash-table that acts as fallback for the sliding forwarding.
   * This is used in the case of G1 serial compaction, which violates the
   * assumption of sliding forwarding that each object of any region is only
   * ever forwarded to one of two target regions. At this point, the GC is
   * scrambling to free up more Java heap memory, and therefore performance
   * is not the major concern.
   *
   * The implementation is a straightforward open hashtable.
   * It is a single-threaded (not thread-safe) implementation, and that
   * is sufficient because G1 serial compaction is single-threaded.
