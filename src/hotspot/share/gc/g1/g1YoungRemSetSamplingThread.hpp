// The G1YoungRemSetSamplingThread is used to re-assess the validity of

// At the end of the GC G1 determines the length of the young gen based on
// how much time the next GC can take, and when the next GC may occur
// according to the MMU.
//
// The assumption is that a significant part of the GC is spent on scanning
// the remembered sets (and many other components), so this thread constantly
// reevaluates the prediction for the remembered set scanning costs, and potentially
// G1Policy resizes the young gen. This may do a premature GC or even
// increase the young gen size to keep pause time length goal.
